Meaning no job control, no auto-completion, no STDERR output, and, most important, poor signal handling and limited commands support. To fully leverage the shell it is convenient to upgrade to an interactive TTY with extended features.
To check if the shell is a TTY shell use the tty command.

Reverse shells, as opposed to bind shells, initiate the connection from the remote host to the local host. They are especially handy and, sometimes the only way, to get remote access across a NAT or firewall.
The chosen shell will depend on the binaries installed on the target system, although uploading a binary can be possible.</description></item><item><title>Restricted Shells</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/shells/restricted-shells/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/shells/restricted-shells/</guid><description>Restricted Shells Restricted shells limit the default available capabilities of a regular shell and allow only a subset of system commands. Typically, a combination of some or all of the following restrictions are set1:
Using the cd command. Setting or unsetting environment variables. Commands that contain slashes. Filename containing a slash as an argument to the . built-in command. Filename containing a slash as an argument to the -p option to the hash built-in command.</description></item></channel></rss>
