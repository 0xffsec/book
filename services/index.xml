FTP is built on a client-server architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP authenticates users with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. 1</description></item><item><title>SMTP - 25 / 465 / 587</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/smtp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/smtp/</guid><description>SMTP is a communication protocol for email transmission. It is commonly used to relay and submit messages to another email servers.
SMTP is a delivery protocol only. Meaning mail is &amp;ldquo;pushed&amp;rdquo; to a destination mail server, or next-hop server, as it arrives. Mail is routed based on the destination server, not individual users to which it is addressed. Other protocols, such as the Post Office Protocol (POP) and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are specifically designed for use by individual users retrieving messages and managing mailboxes.</description></item><item><title>DNS - 53</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/dns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/dns/</guid><description>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, and other resources connected to a network.
It associates different information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more easily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. 1
TCP and UDP By default, DNS uses UDP on port 53 to serve requests.</description></item><item><title>HTTP/S - 80 / 443</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/http-https/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/http-https/</guid><description>Directory Enumeration As a first step, while we browse the web/application, it is a good idea to do some files and directories enumeration, look for unlinked content, temporary directories, and backups.
Widely used tools include dirbuster, gobuster, dirb and the suite Burp.

It provides access via IP to mailboxes maintained on a server.
Because POP was designed for temporary Internet connection, clients connect, retrieve messages, store them on the client, and finally delete them from the server. Clients also have the option to leave messages on the server. By contrast, IMAP was designed to normally leave all messages on the server allowing multiple client applications as online and offline modes.</description></item><item><title>SMB - 139 / 445</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/smb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/smb/</guid><description>SMB is a network communication protocol for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network. It also provides an authenticated IPC (inter-process communication) mechanism.1
Windows SMB Ports and Protocols TL;DR
Port 139: SMB over NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP). port 445: SMB directly over TCP/IP. Originally, in Windows NT, SMB ran on top of NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), which uses ports UDP 137 and 138, and TCP 139.</description></item><item><title>IMAP - 143,993</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/imap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/imap/</guid><description>IMAP is an application-layer protocol used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. It was designed to manage multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. 1
