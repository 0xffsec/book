FTP is built on a client-server architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP authenticates users with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it.</description></item><item><title>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Service Enumeration</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/smtp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/smtp/</guid><description>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) At a Glance Default Ports
SMTP Relay (server-server communication): 25 SMTP Message Submission (client-server communcation): 578 SMTPS (Deprecated): 465 SMTP is a communication protocol for email transmission. It is commonly used to relay and submit messages to another email servers.
SMTP is a delivery protocol only. Meaning mail is &amp;ldquo;pushed&amp;rdquo; to a destination mail server, or next-hop server, as it arrives. Mail is routed based on the destination server, not individual users to which it is addressed.</description></item><item><title>DNS (Domain Name Systems) Service Enumeration</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/dns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/dns/</guid><description>DNS (Domain Name Systems) At a Glance Default Port: 53 The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, and other resources connected to a network. It associates different information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more easily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.</description></item><item><title>Name/Finger (User Information Protocol) Service Enumeration</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/finger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/finger/</guid><description>Finger (User Information Protocol) At a Glance Default Port: 79 The Finger User Information Protocol (RFC 1288), is a simple protocol that provides an interface to a remote user information program (RUIP). 1

HTTP: 80 HTTPS (HTTP over TLS or SSL): 443 HTTP is an application-level protocol for distributed hypermedia information systems. It is the standard protocol that defines how messages are formatted and sent across the web.
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).</description></item><item><title>POP (Post Office Protocol) Service Enumeration</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/pop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/pop/</guid><description>POP (Post Office Protocol) At a Glance Default Ports
POP3: 110 POP3S (POP3 over TLS or SSL): 995 POP, or POP3 (POP version 3), is an application-layer protocol used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. It provides access via IP to mailboxes maintained on a server.
Because POP was designed for temporary Internet connection, clients connect, retrieve messages, store them on the client, and finally delete them from the server.</description></item><item><title>NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol) Service Enumeration</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/nntp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/nntp/</guid><description>NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol) At a Glance Default Ports
NNTP: 119 NNTPS (NNTPS over TLS): 563 NNSP (server-server bulk transfer): 433 NNTP is an application-layer protocol used for transporting Usenet news articles between news servers. Client applications can also inquire, retrieve, and post articles.

RPC Endpoint Mapper: 135 HTTP: 593 MSRPC is an interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism that allows client/server software communcation. That process can be on the same computer, on the local network (LAN), or across the Internet. Its purpose is to provide a common interface between applications.
Within Windows environments, many server applications are exposed via RPC.
The Microsoft RPC mechanism uses other IPC mechanisms, such as named pipes, NetBIOS or Winsock, to establish communications between the client and the server.</description></item><item><title>NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) Service Enumeration</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/netbios/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/netbios/</guid><description>NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) At a Glance Default Port/s:
NetBIOS Name Service: UDP/137 NetBIOS Datagram Service: UDP/138 NetBIOS Session Service: TCP/139 NetBIOS is a non-routable service that allows applications and computers to communicate over a local area network (LAN).
As an API, NetBIOS relies on network protocols to communicate. In modern networks, NetBIOS runs over TCP/IP via the NetBIOS over TCP/IP protocol or NBT.1
NetBIOS provides three distinct services:</description></item><item><title>SMB (Server Message Block) Service Enumeration</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/smb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/smb/</guid><description>SMB (Server Message Block) At a Glance Default Ports
SMB over NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP): 139 SMB over TCP/IP: 445 SMB is a network communication protocol for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network. It also provides an authenticated IPC (inter-process communication) mechanism.1
Windows SMB Ports and Protocols Originally, in Windows NT, SMB ran on top of NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), which uses ports UDP 137 and 138, and TCP 139.</description></item><item><title>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) Service Enumeration</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/imap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/services/imap/</guid><description>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) At a Glance Default Ports
IMAP: 143 IMAPS (IMAP over SSL): 993 IMAP is an application-layer protocol used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. It was designed to manage multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. 1
