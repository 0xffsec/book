Reverse shells, as opposed to bind shells, initiate the connection from the remote host to the local host. They are especially handy and, sometimes the only way, to get remote access across a NAT or firewall.
The chosen shell will depend on the binaries installed on the target system, although uploading a binary can be possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
