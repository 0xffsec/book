These programs also known as CGI scripts or simply CGIs, are commonly executed at the time a request is made and return dynamically generated HTML content.
Most servers expect CGI scripts to reside in a special directory, usually called cgi-bin, to handle the requests correctly and execute the program instead of returning the file content.</description></item><item><title>File Inclusion</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/web-applications/file-inclusion-and-path-traversal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/web-applications/file-inclusion-and-path-traversal/</guid><description>File Inclusion and Path Traversal File Inclusion File inclusion is the method for applications, and scripts, to include local or remote files during run-time. The vulnerability occurs when an application generates a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable, giving the attacker control over which file is executed.
There are two different types. Local File Inclusion (LFI) where the application includes files on the current server. And Remote File Inclusion (RFI) where the application downloads and execute files from a remote server.</description></item></channel></rss>
