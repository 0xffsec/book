These programs also known as CGI scripts or simply CGIs, are commonly executed at the time a request is made and return dynamically generated HTML content.
Most servers expect CGI scripts to reside in a special directory, usually called cgi-bin, to handle the requests correctly and execute the program instead of returning the file content.</description></item></channel></rss>
