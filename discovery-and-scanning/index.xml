Depending on if you are inside the network or scanning remotely, how much noise you can make, and your discovery requirements, different tools, and options are available.
Internal # Passive # Passive discovery relies on monitoring network layer traffic to detect network topology, services, and applications.</description></item><item><title>Port Scanning</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/discovery-and-scanning/port-scanning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/handbook/discovery-and-scanning/port-scanning/</guid><description>Port Scanning # At a Glance # Port scanning helps you gather additional information about the target by interacting with it. It will give you a better understanding of how different systems interact with each other and host-specific details such as operating systems and available services.
Port Scanners # Port scanners can be classified as synchronous and asynchronous.
Synchronous or connection-oriented scanners, like Nmap, wait for the host response to determine if the port is alive.</description></item></channel></rss>
