It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add. This tool makes it possible for researchers and security consultants to show how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access to a system remotely.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra>Github Page</a></p><h2 id=masscan>masscan</h2><p>This is an Internet-scale port scanner. It can scan the entire Internet in under 6 minutes, transmitting 10 million packets per second, from a single machine.<br>It&rsquo;s input/output is similar to <a href=https://0xffsec.com/notebook/tools/#nmap>nmap</a>, the most famous port scanner. When in doubt, try one of those features.<br>Internally, it uses asynchronous transmissions, similar to port scanners like scanrand, unicornscan, and ZMap. It&rsquo;s more flexible, allowing arbitrary port and address ranges.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan>GitHub Page</a></p><h2 id=medusa>Medusa</h2><p>Medusa is intended to be a speedy, massively parallel, modular, login brute-forcer. The goal is to support as many services which allow remote authentication as possible. The author considers following items as some of the key features of this application:</p><p><a href=http://foofus.net/goons/jmk/medusa/medusa.html>Official Homepage</a></p><h2 id=msfconsole>MSFConsole</h2><p>The most popular interface to the Metasploit Framework (MSF). It provides an “all-in-one” centralized console and allows you efficient access to virtually all of the options available in the MSF.</p><p><a href=https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole/>Official Homepage</a></p><h2 id=nbtscan>nbtscan</h2><p>This is a command-line tool that scans for open <code>NETBIOS</code> nameservers on a local or remote TCP/IP network, and this is a first step in finding of open shares. It is based on the functionality of the standard Windows tool <code>nbtstat</code>, but it operates on a range of addresses instead of just one. I wrote this tool because the existing tools either didn&rsquo;t do what I wanted or ran only on the Windows platforms: mine runs on just about everything.</p><p><a href=http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html>Official Homepage</a></p><h2 id=netcat>Netcat</h2><p>Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol.<br>It is designed to be a reliable &ldquo;back-end&rdquo; tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.</p><p><a href=http://netcat.sourceforge.net/>Official Homepage</a></p><h2 id=netdiscover>netdiscover</h2><p>Active/passive ARP reconnaissance tool.</p><p><a href=https://manpages.debian.org/testing/netdiscover/netdiscover.8.en.html>Debian&rsquo;s Reference Manual</a></p><h2 id=nmap>Nmap</h2><p>Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.</p><p><a href=https://nmap.org/>Official Homepage</a></p><h2 id=p0f>p0f</h2><p>P0f is a tool that utilizes an array of sophisticated, purely passive traffic fingerprinting mechanisms to identify the players behind any incidental TCP/IP communications (often as little as a single normal <code>SYN</code>) without interfering in any way.</p><p><a href=https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/>Official Homepage</a></p><h2 id=ping>ping</h2><p>Send ICMP <code>ECHO_REQUEST</code> packets to network hosts.</p><p><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ping&sektion=8">FreeBSD System Manager&rsquo;s Manual</a></p><h2 id=searchsploit>SearchSploit</h2><p>Command line search tool for <a href=https://www.exploit-db.com/>Exploit-DB</a> that also allows you to take a copy of Exploit Database with you, everywhere you go. SearchSploit gives you the power to perform detailed off-line searches through your locally checked-out copy of the repository. This capability is particularly useful for security assessments on segregated or air-gapped networks without Internet access.</p><p><a href=https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit>Official Homepage</a></p><h2 id=telnet>Telnet</h2><p>User interface to TELNET.</p><p><a href=http://telnet.org/>Official Homepage</a></p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/0xffsec/notebook/commit/dfd25a171d11c1ed79df76194f20400c6f1bdc4e title="Last modified by Max Rodrigo | May 11, 2020" target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/notebook/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
