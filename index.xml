Default Port: 21
FTP is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of files between a client and a server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP authenticates users with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it.</description></item><item><title>SMTP - 25 / 465 / 587</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/smtp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/smtp/</guid><description>SMTP Simple Mails Transfer Protocol.
Default Ports
SMTP Relay (server-server communication): 25 SMTP Message Submission (client-server communcation): 578 SMTPS (Deprecated): 465 SMTP is a communication protocol for email transmission. It is commonly used to relay and submit messages to another email servers.
SMTP is a delivery protocol only. Meaning mail is &amp;ldquo;pushed&amp;rdquo; to a destination mail server, or next-hop server, as it arrives. Mail is routed based on the destination server, not individual users to which it is addressed.</description></item><item><title>DNS - 53</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/dns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/dns/</guid><description>DNS Domain Name Systems.
Default Port: 53
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, and other resources connected to a network. It associates different information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more easily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. 1</description></item><item><title>Finger - 79</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/finger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/finger/</guid><description>Finger Finger user information protocol.

Depending on if you are inside the network or scanning remotely, how much noise you can make, and your discovery requirements, different tools, and options are available.
Internal Passive Passive discovery relies on monitoring network layer traffic to detect network topology, services, and applications. The process does not generate any network traffic.</description></item><item><title>Port Scanning</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/discovery-and-scanning/port-scanning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/discovery-and-scanning/port-scanning/</guid><description>Port Scanning Let&amp;rsquo;s continue narrowing down our attack vector. It is time now to grab your host or list of hosts and scan for open ports and running services.
Port scanners can be categorized between synchronous or connection-oriented and asynchronous or connectionless.
Synchronous scanners, like Nmap, wait for a host response (until the timeout period expires) to determine if the port it&amp;rsquo;s alive. This translates to slower scans, especially on big network ranges, but an accurate port discovery in comparison with connectionless scanners.</description></item><item><title>POP - 110 / 995</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/pop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/pop/</guid><description>POP Post Office Protocol.
Default Ports
POP3: 110 POP3S (POP3 over TLS or SSL): 995 POP, or POP3 (POP version 3), is an application-layer protocol used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. It provides access via IP to mailboxes maintained on a server.
Because POP was designed for temporary Internet connection, clients connect, retrieve messages, store them on the client, and finally delete them from the server.</description></item><item><title>NNTP - 119 / 433 / 563</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/nntp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/services/nntp/</guid><description>NNTP Network News Transfer Protocol.

Reverse shells, as opposed to bind shells, initiate the connection from the remote host to the local host. They are especially handy and, sometimes the only way, to get remote access across a NAT or firewall.
The chosen shell will depend on the binaries installed on the target system, although uploading a binary can be possible.</description></item><item><title>Restricted Shells</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/shells/restricted-shells/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/shells/restricted-shells/</guid><description>Restricted Shells Restricted shells limit the default available capabilities of a regular shell and allow only a subset of system commands. Typically, a combination of some or all of the following restrictions are set1:

These programs also known as CGI scripts or simply CGIs, are commonly executed at the time a request is made and return dynamically generated HTML content.
Most servers expect CGI scripts to reside in a special directory, usually called cgi-bin, to handle the requests correctly and execute the program instead of returning the file content.</description></item><item><title>Command Injection</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/web-applications/command-injection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/web-applications/command-injection/</guid><description>Command Injection Command injection is an attack in which the attacker executes arbitrary commands on the host OS via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user-supplied data to a system shell. 1

The vulnerability occurs when an application generates a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable, giving the attacker control over which file is executed.
There are two different types. Local File Inclusion (LFI) where the application includes files on the current server. And Remote File Inclusion (RFI) where the application downloads and execute files from a remote server.</description></item><item><title>How to Open JAR files</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/book/notes/how-to-open-jar-files/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/book/notes/how-to-open-jar-files/</guid><description>How to Open JAR Files A JAR (Java ARchive) file is a package file format, based on the ZIP file format, used to aggregate many Java class files, metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution.1
