FTP is built on a client-server architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP authenticates users with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. 1</description></item><item><title>HTTP/S - 80 / 443</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/notebook/enumeration/http-https/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/notebook/enumeration/http-https/</guid><description>Directory Enumeration As a first step, while we browse the web/application, it is a good idea to do some files and directories enumeration, look for unlinked content, temporary directories, and backups.
Widely used tools include dirbuster, gobuster, dirb and the suite Burp.
Wordlists Included in Kali&amp;rsquo;s wordlists package.
dirbuster&amp;rsquo;s medium 2.3.
/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt dirb common.
/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt dirb big.
/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt Not included in Kali.

Depending on if you are inside the network or scanning remotely, how much noise you can make, and your discovery requirements, different tools, and options are available.
Internal Passive Passive discovery relies on monitoring network layer traffic to detect network topology, services, and applications. The process does not generate any network traffic.</description></item><item><title>Port Scanning</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/notebook/discovery-and-scanning/port-scanning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/notebook/discovery-and-scanning/port-scanning/</guid><description>Port Scanning Let&amp;rsquo;s continue narrowing down our attack vector. It is time now to grab your host or list of hosts and scan for open ports and running services.
Port scanners can be categorized between synchronous or connection-oriented and asynchronous or connectionless.
Synchronous scanners, like Nmap, wait for a host response (until the timeout period expires) to determine if the port it&amp;rsquo;s alive. This translates to slower scans, especially on big network ranges, but an accurate port discovery in comparison with connectionless scanners.</description></item><item><title>SMB - 139 / 445</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/notebook/enumeration/smb/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/notebook/enumeration/smb/</guid><description>SMB is a network communication protocol for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network. It also provides an authenticated IPC (inter-process communication) mechanism.1
Windows SMB Ports and Protocols TL;DR
Port 139 serves SMB over NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) and, port 445, SMB directly over TCP/IP. Originally, in Windows NT, SMB ran on top of NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), which uses ports UDP 137 and 138, and TCP 139.</description></item><item><title>Exploits Search</title><link>https://0xffsec.com/notebook/exploits-search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://0xffsec.com/notebook/exploits-search/</guid><description>Exploits Search Offline searchsploit 1 Periodically update the database with searchsploit -u. Search vulnerabilities based on a Nmap&amp;rsquo;s XML result.
searchsploit --nmap nmap.xml Basic search and copy the exploit the current directory.
For more examples, see the manual.
searchsploit afd windows local searchsploit -m 39446 Parameters -u: Check for and install any exploitdb package updates. -m: Copies an exploit to the current working directory. --nmap &amp;lt;xml file&amp;gt;: Checks all results in Nmap&amp;rsquo;s XML output with service version.</description></item></channel></rss>
