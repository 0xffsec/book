Depending on if you are inside the network or scanning remotely, how much noise you can make, and your discovery requirements, different tools, and options are available.\nInternal Passive Passive discovery relies on monitoring network layer traffic to detect network topology, services, and applications. The process does not generate any network traffic.\nAlthough is a slow process compared to an active scan and unreliable for service enumeration, as no packets are injected in the network, there is no risk of unintentional service disruption. Giving the advantage of being able to find intermittently offered or protected services that are often missed by active scanning. 1\nnetdiscover - ARP 2 sudo netdiscover -p  -p: passive mode. It does not send anything, but does only sniff.  p0f - Fingerprinting 3 sudo p0f -p  -p: promiscuous mode; by default, it listens only to packet addressed or routed through.\nOn IP-enabled interfaces can be detected remotely.  Active In contrast, active discovery does inject a variety of packets into the network, making it well suited for open port discovery and fingerprinting. However, these techniques are not without drawbacks. Scans can be invasive, generate too much noise and, in some cases cause service interruptions due to the type of packets that may be sent.\nnetdiscover - ARP 2 sudo netdiscover -r 10.0.0.0/24  -r \u0026lt;range\u0026gt;: scan a given range instead of auto scan.  Nmap nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24  -sn: No port scan AKA ping scan. 4 Consists of an ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP ACK to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request by default.  nbtscan - NetBIOS 5 sudo nbtscan 10.0.0.0/24 ICMP Refer to External ICMP Scanning\nExternal ICMP As defined in RFC 792, ICMP messages are typically used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in response to errors in IP operations (as specified in RFC 1122).6\nAlthough it is possible to use ICMP requests to discover if a host is up or not, it is common to find all these packets being filtered, making it an unreliable method.\nping ping -c 1 10.0.0.1  -c \u0026lt;count\u0026gt;: stops after count replies.  fping 7 fping -g 10.10.0.0/24  -g, --generate \u0026lt;target\u0026gt;: generates target list. target can be start and end IP or a CIDR address.  Nmap nmap -PEPM -sn -n 10.0.0.0/24   Parameters   -PE; -PP; -PM: ICMP echo, timestamp, and netmask request discovery probes. -sn: No port scan. -n: No DNS resolution.   Port Discovery Another commonly used technique is port scanning. It allows you to identify running services, consequently, interesting hosts. See Port Scanning.\nReference   Whyte, David.

It is time now to grab your host or list of hosts and scan for open ports and running services.\nPort scanners can be categorized between synchronous or connection-oriented and asynchronous or connectionless.\nSynchronous scanners, like Nmap, wait for a host response (until the timeout period expires) to determine if the port it\u0026rsquo;s alive. This translates to slower scans, especially on big network ranges, but an accurate port discovery in comparison with connectionless scanners.\nAsynchronous scanners like scanrad, zmap, or masscan, on the other hand, don\u0026rsquo;t wait for a host response as they create separate threads for each port. This allows a high-speed scan, but less accurate since they cannot detect dropped packets.\nCombining both tools could help you find a balance between speed and accuracy for each engagement. 1\nNetwork Sweep masscan 2 sudo masscan -p 7,9,13,21-23,25-26,37,53,79-81,88,106,110-111,113,119,135,139,143-144,179,199,389,427,443-445,465,513-515,543-544,548,554,587,631,646,873,990,993,995,1025-1029,1110,1433,1720,1723,1755,1900,2000-2001,2049,2121,2717,3000,3128,3306,3389,3986,4899,5000,5009,5051,5060,5101,5190,5357,5432,5631,5666,5800,5900,6000-6001,6646,7070,8000,8008-8009,8080-8081,8443,8888,9100,9999-10000,32768,49152-49157 --rate 50000 --wait 0 --open-only -oG masscan.gnmap 10.0.0.0/24   Parameters   -p \u0026lt;ports\u0026gt;: port(s) to be scanned. --rate \u0026lt;rate\u0026gt;: rate for transmitting packets (packet per seconds). --wait \u0026lt;seconds\u0026gt;: seconds after transmit is done to wait for receiving packets before exiting.
